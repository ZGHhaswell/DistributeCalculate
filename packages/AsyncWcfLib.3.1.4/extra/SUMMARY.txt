== AsynWcfLib ==

AsyncWcfLib is a software library for distributed computing based on Microsoft WCF.
AsyncWcfLib is a lightweight message bus bridging Windows and Linux by using the .NET Framework or Mono.
It supports callback based asynchrony as well as the new async-await pattern available in .NET 4.5.

AsyncWcfLib supports threadsafety through an actor based programming model.
Actors are loosly coupled system units interacting by passing messages.
Message objects are passed inside a process between actors running on different threads.
Also, messages may be passed between actors running on different processes, hosts and operating systems.

The library is designed for configuration free, asynchronous messaging.
A router application is included. It discovers actors by their name on any linked host, even 
when host name resolution is not possible because of routing- or operating system limitations.

Large computing intense systems tend to be distributed applications interacting through asynchronous message exchange.
Important requirements in such systems are:

    * Individual application upgrade without breaking existing, running partner applications.
    * Automatic reconnect and failure recovery after network interruption. 

AsyncWcfLib focuses on such systems, used e.g. for industrial control and automation.
It is written in C-sharp and currently available for Microsoft VisualStudio 2012, 2010 and Mono.

All content of http://AsyncWcfLib.sourceforge.net is released under a modified MIT open source license.
It lets you use the software in your own, possibly closed source project.

=== How to start ===

Download AsyncWcfLib-Vx.y.z.zip from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/asyncwcflib>.
Read <http://sourceforge.net/p/asyncwcflib/wiki/Run AsyncWcfLib.Test1>

Or download the NuGet package "AsyncWcfLib" with Visual Studio 2012 package manager tool and look for the unit tests.
(see <http://nuget.org/packages/AsyncWcfLib>)



=== How to get latest library sourcecode ===

You need a subversion commandline client.
To create a workingcopy enter "svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/asyncwcflib/code/trunk trunk".

Or have a look on the SourceForge Download page select "Code" and "trunk".
Currently you cannot, but may be in future you can "Download a GNU tarball".
This is a zip file containing the latest sourcecode.
